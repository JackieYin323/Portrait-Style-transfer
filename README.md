# Portrait-Style-transfer
The neural style transfer on portrait project aims to take two images, a content image(human portrait specifically) and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and employ Material Optimal Descriptor Network (MODNet) to remove background and use VGG19 to convert the human's selfies into a another portrait that is artistically beautiful.
